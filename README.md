# How-does-Bail-Bonds-Work

Bail bonds work in the same way as personal loans. A bail bondsman, or agent, will give you the remainder of the bail money after you have paid a small amount. This bail agent or bail bondsman is similar to a personal loan lender. If your bail is $15,000 you would need to deposit $2,000. If your bail is $15,000, a bail bondsman would require that you or a family member make a deposit of $2,000. Collateral can be a deed to your home, a piece of jewellery, or a car. 

The collateral is used to secure <a href="https://g.page/espinoza-bail-bonds-san-jose?share">San Jose bail bonds</a> loans in the event you fail to appear at your court date. In that case, you will not receive your money back. The court will return your money to the bail bond company that you have received bail money from after your trial ends.

Because this is a financial risk that the bail bondsman or bail bond company takes because of the loan, they may take extra precautions to ensure you are there for all court dates. The bail bondsman will want to ensure that his or her company gets all of the bail money it lent you. Bail bond companies often do the following to take precautions:
It is preferable that a friend or relative puts up the collateral to secure your bond. You will be less likely not to miss a court date if your relative or friend has put up the collateral for your bail bond.
To remind you about your upcoming trial, call you before every court date
You will be required to check in at the bail bond office on a regular basis to ensure that you aren't leaving town.
You will likely agree with most defendants that these precautions are small price to pay to avoid jail time while you wait for your trial or to get out of jail.
